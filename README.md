# JVM Wrapper Launcher
A lightweight and flexible Java-based wrapper designed to launch target JAR files with custom JVM arguments. Ideal for environments or hosting platforms where direct modification of JVM parameters is restricted. Simply configure your desired arguments and target application, and this wrapper handles the rest.

## How to Use
- Download ```Launcher.jar```
- Place it on your root directory where ```server.jar``` is located
- Make the startup executable ```Launcher.jar``` instead of ```server.jar```

## How to Edit the Startup Command
- Open ```settings.properties```
- You can change all the JVM arguments there
